16 | Hex | Asset ID | Uniquely identifies this asset on the server. May be null (-1) if offline.

## Use in Package Files
A similar format is used inside of various Spore package files (DBPFs/database packed files), including `Spore_Content.package` (Maxis creations) and `editorSaves.package` (creations made locally).

The metadata for an asset is in its own file, with an extension of `.pollen_metadata`. `.pmet` is also believed to be a valid extension. A hex editor is needed to view and edit the data.

The metadata has the following format:
